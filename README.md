To complete Task 8, I used ProtonVPN (Free Tier) to explore the role of VPNs in securing online communication and protecting privacy. I started by creating a free account on ProtonVPN.com, then downloaded and installed the desktop client on my system.

Before connecting to the VPN, I visited https://whatismyipaddress.com, which showed my real IP address as 157.51.132.253, located in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India, and provided by Reliance Jio Infocomm. This confirmed I was unprotected and publicly visible.

Next, I launched ProtonVPN and clicked the “Connect” button, which automatically selected the fastest free server. Once connected, I visited the IP check site again and found that my IP had changed to 185.132.178.158, now showing a location in Naaldwijk, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands, with the ISP as WorldStream B.V. (VPN Server). The site even displayed the message “Looks like you're using a VPN!”, confirming that ProtonVPN had successfully masked my real location and encrypted my traffic.

I browsed a few websites while connected, and although the browsing speed was slightly reduced, all sites loaded normally, indicating the VPN tunnel was working effectively. I then disconnected the VPN and refreshed the IP checker, which showed my original Indian IP again — confirming that ProtonVPN reverted to the original network after disconnection.

From this task, I learned that VPNs encrypt internet traffic, making it unreadable to ISPs, trackers, and hackers, especially on public Wi-Fi. They also hide your IP address, providing anonymity and allowing access to region-restricted content. However, free VPNs may have fewer server choices and slightly reduced speeds. Overall, this task showed how VPNs are valuable tools for enhancing online privacy and protecting user data.
